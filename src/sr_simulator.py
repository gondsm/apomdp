"""
This script implements a ROS node for simulating a search and rescue scenario. The node is
responsible for maintaining the (true) state of the world, receiving actions from the agents
replying with noisy observations. This essentially done based on the assumptions that are specified
in the config/*.yaml files.

The node is also responsible for broadcasting messages to agents, introducing noise in the
communication under the form of lost messages. This is done using the inverse-square law to
model a noisy channel with message loss.
