# Type and method definitions for the $\alpha$POMDP.
# This script defines the aPOMDP types and associated functions that allow
# for the definition and solving of this POMDP.
# It has been tested using Julia0.6 and the QMDP solver
# POMDPs
using POMDPs, POMDPModels, POMDPToolbox

# Solvers
using QMDP, SARSOP#, DESPOT, MCVI # (MCVI is failing on load)

# Other stuff
using IterTools
